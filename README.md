# Shopping-Cart-Spring-Boot
â€œI developed a Shopping Cart application using Spring Boot that allows users to browse products, add them to a cart, and place orders. The backend is powered by Spring Boot and MySQL, while the frontend uses Thymeleaf and Bootstrap. Admins can manage products and view orders, and customers can track order status and manage their cart.
